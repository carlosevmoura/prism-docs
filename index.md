# Prism Documentation

Welcome to the *Prism Documentation*, a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for the [**Prism**](https://www.github.com/sokolov-group/prism) package. **Prism** is a powerful Python-based tool designed to simulate spectroscopic properties by implementing cutting-edge electronic structure theories.

This documentation is specifically crafted for individuals who are potential users of the **Prism** and researchers who are interested in exploring multireference methods for excited states. Authored by members of the [Sokolov Group](https://research.cbc.osu.edu/sokolov.8/), its primary focus is to provide comprehensive and accessible resources that enable users and developers to effectively leverage **Prism**'s capabilities.

**Prism** is a Python3 based open-source ([GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/sokolov-group/prism/blob/main/LICENSE)) code, and can be obtained on [GitHub](https://github.com/sokolov-group/prism).
